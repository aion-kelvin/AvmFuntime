# Run simple node demonstration:

- Before running the demo, you need to install avm branch of aion_web3: `npm install https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion_web3#avm` (run this from the location that myhack.js is stored)
- Then, you can run the demo: `node myhack.js`

# Doing stuff from a website demonstration:
- Get a minified .js file of the aion_web3 avm branch by doing ONE (1) of the following:
  - (easy way) Just use the file I've prepared: http://github
  - (hard way) Or create your own using the aion_web3 avm branch source code (see "Web use" in the README) - https://github.com/aionnetwork/aion_web3/blob/avm/README.md
- Open myhack.html in your browser
